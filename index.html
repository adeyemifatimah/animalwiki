            <p>Deer is a wild animal that belongs to the Cervidae family. It is in the order of Artiodactyla, which
                means mammals with even toe hooves with each one of their foot having two small and two large hooves.
                Deers have about 50 species such as the reindeer, red deer, elk, white-tailed deer, and moose among
                others. Deer were originally found in continents such as Asia, North America, Northern Africa, Europe,
                and South America, the were, later on, take to countries like the Republic of South Africa, New Zealand,
                and Australia.

                They also have one distinct characteristic that distinguishes them from the rest of the ruminants in
                that, almost every species of deer have antlers. These are an outgrowth structure that originates from
                the head and does not have Keratin present like the one found in true horns. Deers live in habitats with
                plenty of woodland terrains, especially those that are rugged and it is perhaps the reason they have
                long and robust legs, and compact and flexible bodies to help them survive i</p>

                Like hawks and eagles, owls are called raptors, or birds of prey, which means they use sharp talons and
                curved bills to hunt, kill, and eat other animals.

                ​

                But owls are different from hawks and eagles in several ways. Most owls have huge heads, stocky bodies,
                soft feathers, short tails, and a reversible toe that can point either forward or backward. Owl’s eyes
                face forward, like humans do. Most owl species are active at night, not in the daytime.

                ​

                There are about 250 species of owls in the world. They live on every continent except icy Antarctica.

                ​

                Owls belong to a group of birds called Strigiformes. That group is divided into two smaller groups,
                known as families. The family called Tytonidae includes Barn Owls, which have heart-shaped faces. The
                second family, Strigidae, includes all other owls, most of which have round faces.

                ​

                Many owls vocalize at a distinctively low frequency, which allows their songs to travel long distances
                without being absorbed by vegetation. Becoming familiar with these songs and other vocalizations will
                help you find and identify owls.

        <div id="leo">

            <p>Leopards are graceful and powerful big cats closely related to lions, tigers, and jaguars. They live in
                sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their populations
                are endangered, especially outside of Africa.

                Hunting Skills
                The leopard is so strong and comfortable in trees that it often hauls its kills into the branches. By
                dragging the bodies of large animals aloft it hopes to keep them safe from scavengers such as hyenas.
                Leopards can also hunt from trees, where their spotted coats allow them to blend with the leaves until
                they spring with a deadly pounce. These nocturnal predators also stalk antelope, deer, and pigs by
                stealthy movements in the tall grass. When human settlements are present, leopards often attack dogs
                and, occasionally, people.

                Leopards are strong swimmers and very much at home in the water, where they sometimes eat fish or crabs.

                Breeding
                Female leopards can give birth at any time of the year. They usually have two grayish cubs with barely
                visible spots. The mother hides her cubs and moves them from one safe location to the next until they
                are old enough to begin playing and learning to hunt. Cubs live with their mothers for about two
                years—otherwise, leopards are solitary animals.

                Leopard Spots
                Most leopards are light colored with distinctive dark spots that are called rosettes, because they
                resemble the shape of a rose. Black leopards, which appear to be almost solid in color because their
                spots are hard to distinguish, are commonly called black panthers.
